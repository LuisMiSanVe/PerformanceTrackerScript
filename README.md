Script Menu with performance tracking and enhance options.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites
Some options require [NVIDIA drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/drivers/) to be installed (so obviously, only supports NVIDIA graphic cards), be sure to have the latest installed!

## ðŸ“– About the Project
The script's options can be categorized into two:
- **Performance Track**: Several options provide data on the performance, usage, and temperature of your components.
- **Performance Enhance**: If your PC has low RAM, the operating system may store processes on the disk (a much slower memory than RAM) causing the system to slow down. This option relocates those processes to improve the computer's efficiency. It will only work if you have a SNAP partition on your disk (which is automatically created by [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) during setup unless you manually disable it).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This Script was tested on a computer with an **Intel** processor and a [NVIDIA graphics card](https://www.nvidia.com/) with [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) Linux, other brands may not be compatible.
